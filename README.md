# Ride Weather

A one-screen, low-bandwidth weather nowcast for cycling in Austria, built for GitHub Pages.
Shows a live clock, your location, current temperature, a plain-English rain outlook, wind,
and three aligned 15-minute bar charts (rain / temperature / wind with direction arrows)
covering the recent past and the next 3 hours — plus an auto-looping rain radar
(40 km across, 1 km resolution) over a CARTO Voyager base map.

Data: [GeoSphere Austria](https://www.geosphere.at/) INCA nowcast
(`nowcast-v1-15min-1km`, CC BY 4.0). Coverage is Austria and its close
surroundings (45.5–49.5° N, 8.1–17.7° E).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `ride-weather`).
2. Push all files in this folder to the default branch
   (`mockup.html` is the design mockup — optional, safe to delete).
3. Repo → Settings → Pages → "Deploy from a branch" → select the branch, folder `/ (root)`.
4. Open `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` on your phone, allow location.
5. Install as an app: Android Chrome → menu → "Add to Home screen";
   iPhone Safari → Share → "Add to Home Screen".

No build step, no API keys, no server.

## URL parameters

| Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `?nomap=1` | Skips the whole radar panel — no grid download, no tiles, no NetCDF parser. Charts get the freed space. |
| `?loc=48.30,16.32` | Use fixed coordinates instead of the geolocation prompt (handy for desktop testing). |

## How it stays fast on a weak connection

- **Priority order**: two ~1 KB API calls render everything above the radar first;
  then the ~45 KB radar grid (NetCDF, parsed in-browser); map tiles load **last**.
- **Requests per visit** (after the first): 2 API calls (~2 KB) + place name from
  localStorage cache + radar grid (~45 KB) + tiles only if not already cached.
- The app shell (HTML + NetCDF parser + icons) is pre-cached by a service worker —
  repeat opens don't touch the network for any asset.
- Map tiles are cached (capped at 120) — riding in your usual area costs no tile traffic.
- System fonts, no frameworks, no CDN scripts.
